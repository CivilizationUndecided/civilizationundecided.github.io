Well. This is my first blog post on a (currently) very barebones-looking website powered by GitHub Pages. I decided to start this blog after reading [Garry Newman's](https://garry.net) blog stretching back 22 years. Let's get into what I am currently up to. I run a few online game servers, and I manage a very small community called [oldonlinegames.com](https://www.oldonlinegames.com) or (oog.gg). I've also been working on some games, such as a Nations-Style game, but none have gone anywhere yet. The blog and username are based on a random username generated online.
